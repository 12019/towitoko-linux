	* Released 2.0.7
	* Applied patch by Antti Tapaninen that contains some portability 
	  fixes, fixes compiler warnings and errors for some C/C++ compiler 
	  and also adds support for AIX and NetBSD.
	* Fixed support for writing to long I2C cards. Thanks Martin Preuss.
	* Cleaned IO_Serial_SetProperties() code. Hopefully this fixes 
	  support for inverse convention cards.
	* Always select first protocol proposed by the ATR and default to T=0 
	  if no protocol is available.
	* The output of Get Status of CardTerminal command is now more 
	  descriptive.
	* Miscellaneous improvements to the tester application.
	* USB support is enabled by default under Linux. A new option,
	  --enable-usb-bundle is used to install PCSC Lite USB bundle.
	* Compiling under CygWin 32 environment now generates a Windows DLL
	  named cygtowitoko-2.dll. You'll need to run "reconf" before
	  configure, having libtool 1.4e or greater installed.
	* Compiling under CygWin 32 environment automatically selects the 
	  option --enable-win32-com.

2002-03-17  Carlos Prados  <>

	* Released 2.0.6
	* Implemented 115200 bps baudrate for processor and memory cards.
	* Disabled transportation of APDUs by T=0 protocol following ISO 7816-4 
	  Annex A. Implemented option --enable-ISO-t0 to enable it.
	* Fixed the number of null bytes (0x60) that T=0 protocol accepts from 
	  the card before aborting transmission.
	* Rewritten algorithm for memory smartcard type and memory size 
	  detection.
	* Implemented fake ATR return for I2C cards. This provides a way for 
	  applications to retrieve smartcard memory size and smartcard type.
	* Implemented the ability to select DIR, ATR and application data
	  sections with memory cards according to MCT v09 part 5 spec.
	* Fixed Read Binary command with memory cards to return all data
	  available of the selected data section when Le=0 is specified.
	* Implemented dynamic memory allocation of internal data buffers in
	  protocol_sync and protocol_t1 for memory usage optimization.
	* Added support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD. By Martin Preuss

	  option --enable-debug=4.
	* Implemented the ability to use Windows CT-API style port numbering 
	  with the option --enable-win32-com.
	* Modified EJECT ICC: don't check eject handling instructions, so it 
	  will not fail if the application uses CT-BCS 1.0 semantics. Return OK
	  if the card is not removed and 0 seconds time limit is specified.
	* Corrected  type of parameter in ctapi (3) manpage.
	* Updated and summarized README file.
	* Updated to Autoconf 2.52.

	* Fixed unassigned return value in protocol_t1.c when a 4 bytes
	  block was read.
	* Removed read-only probe of I2C cards in icc_sync.c that could lead
	  to wrong detection of long I2C cards.
	* Implemented configuration option --disable-atr-timings for cards
	  whose ATR doesn't encode timings as defined by ISO 7816-3.
	* Fixed icc_async.c to use a second buffer for reversing bytes sent
	  to an inverse convention card.

2001-01-14  Carlos Prados  <>

	* Released 2.0.2

2000-06-11  Carlos Prados  <>

	* Released 2.0.0-pre3.

	  corrections to comments, debug messages and documentation.

2000-06-10  Carlos Prados  <>
