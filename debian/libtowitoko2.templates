_Description: On which serial port is connected the smart card reader?
 PCSC needs to know on which serial port the reader is connected. This
 information is stored in the file /etc/reader.conf.
 .
 You should not edit this file directly but create or modify a file in
 /etc/reader.conf.d/ and use update-reader.conf(8) to regenerate
 /etc/reader.conf.
